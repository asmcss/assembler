# Assembler CSS

Assembler CSS is a highly performant utility-first framework that allows you to quickly prototype and build modern 
websites and UI components without the need to install and maintain complex software.

## Usage

Incorporating Assembler CSS within your project is a trivial task. 
Just add a `script` tag before the `head` closing tag, and you are good to go!

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>My Page</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <!-- Other resources here -->
    <!-- ... -->
    <!-- Assembler CSS -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@asmcss/assembler@0.2.0/dist/assembler.min.js"></script>
</head>    
<body>
<!-- Your code here -->
</body>
</html>
```

Now you are ready to try out Assembler CSS and write your first UI component.

```html
<div x-style="max-w:80; mx:auto; radius:md; e:2; e.hover:4; transition:all 0.25s; cursor:pointer">
    <img x-style="block; max-w:100%; w:100%; h:auto; radius-top:md" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512621776951-a57141f2eefd?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=640&q=80">
    <div x-style="p:4">
        <div x-style="text:lg; color:black; font-weight:700">Fresh veggies</div>
        <div x-style="text:sm; color:silver; font-weight:400">600g</div>
        <p x-style="pt:4">
            Any veggie can belong on your menu, so choose what you love and use the rest
            for future meals and snacks you can enjoy in flavorful ways.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
```
